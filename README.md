## 📖 Summary

### ✅ What is Regression?

Regression occurs when a new change introduces bugs in previously working functionality.  
*Example:* Updating a WordPress plugin breaks the checkout page on an e-commerce site.

### ❓ Why Regression Happens

- Code changes affect unexpected parts of the system  
- Inadequate testing or rushed development  
- Poor communication and technical debt  

### 💸 Cost of Regression Bugs

- **Financial Loss**: Bug fixes and revenue loss  
- **Reputation**: Loss of user trust  
- **Time**: Delayed releases  
> *Example:* The 2017 Equifax breach, costing over $1.4 billion.

### 🛡️ Regression Testing

- Re-running tests to ensure existing features work  
- Manual & automated approaches  
- Early detection prevents costly failures

### 🧪 Building a Test Suite

- Focus on critical functionalities  
- High-risk and user-impact areas  
- Cover edge cases  
> *Example:* Login, search, add to cart, checkout in an e-commerce site

### ⚙️ Automating Regression Tests

- **Benefits**: Speed, reliability, consistency  
- **Tools**: Selenium, Cypress, JUnit, TestNG  
- **CI/CD Integration**: Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI

### 🔄 CI/CD and Regression

- Run automated tests on every commit  
- Get immediate feedback and prevent production bugs  
- Accelerates delivery with confidence

### 🧠 Prevention Strategies

- Code reviews and unit testing  
- Integration testing  
- Clear requirements and documentation

## ✅ Conclusion

- Regression is **inevitable**, but manageable  
- **Invest in automation** and continuous testing  
- **Improve processes regularly** to maintain software quality  
- Leads to better software and happier users
